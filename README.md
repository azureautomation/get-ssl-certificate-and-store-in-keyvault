Get SSL Certificate and store in Keyvault
=========================================

            

Using Let's Encrpyt as the (free) Certificate Authority, obtains a SSL Certificate for a specific subdomain... EG.  westeurope4.azdemo.co.uk or for a wildcard... EG. *.azdemo.co.uk


The Certificate is stored in Keyvault where it can then be leveraged with other scripts to assign to services such as Web Apps and Application Gateway.


As prerequisites;


  *  Have an existing Key Vault  
  *  You must be using Azure to manage your DNS Zone  

 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
